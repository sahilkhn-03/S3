### Project Overview

The Employee Salary Management System is designed to streamline the processes involved in managing employee salaries, including tracking, updating, and reporting compensation details. The system allows users to add, update, search, sort, and delete employee salary information efficiently. Utilizing appropriate data structures ensures effective data storage and retrieval, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. A menu-based user interface simplifies user interactions.

### Key Features of the System

- **Employee Registration:**  
  Add new employee records with attributes such as Name, Employee ID, Department, Salary, and Joining Date.

- **Salary Update:**  
  Allow users to update salary details, including adjustments for raises or bonuses.

- **Sorting:**  
  The system can sort employee records based on various attributes, such as Name, Employee ID, or Salary.

- **Search:**  
  Users can search the salary database using attributes such as Name, Employee ID, or Department.

- **Data Saving & Loading:**  
  Employee salary data can be saved to a text file and retrieved when restarting the system.

### Data Structures Used

- **Linked Lists:**  
  Used to store employee records, where each node represents an employee's details.

- **Pointer Array:**  
  Each node's pointer is added to an array, allowing for more efficient searching and sorting operations.

### Algorithms Used

- **Linear Search:**  
  Utilized for searching when the employee records are unsorted.

- **Binary Search:**  
  Employed for searching within sorted employee records.

- **Merge Sort:**  
  Used for sorting the employee records based on selected attributes.

- **Bubble Sort:**  
  Implemented for insertion operations when maintaining sorted order.

### System Design

#### Menu

The user interface will consist of a menu offering various options, handled through switch cases. The menu will loop until the user chooses to exit the program.

1. **Employee Registration**  
   - Create a new node for the employee.
   - Add necessary data to the node.
   - Link the new node to the previous node.
   - If auto-sorting is enabled, use bubble sort to maintain order.

2. **Salary Update**  
   - Search for the employee record to be updated.
   - Update the salary information.
   - If the sorted attribute is changed, re-sort the array.

3. **Employee Deletion**  
   - Search for the employee to be deleted.
   - Remove the employee record from the list.
   - Update the pointer array accordingly.

4. **Sorting**  
   - Select an attribute for sorting.
   - Use merge sort to quickly organize the records.

5. **Searching**  
   - Choose the attribute to search by.
   - Check if the array is sorted based on the selected attribute.
     - If sorted, perform a binary search.
     - If unsorted, use linear search.

6. **Data Saving**  
   - Open the save file using file handling.
   - Write each employee's data to the file sequentially.

### Conclusion

The Employee Salary Management System aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing employee compensation. By leveraging appropriate data structures and algorithms, the system ensures quick data retrieval and processing, ultimately contributing to better employee management and satisfaction.
